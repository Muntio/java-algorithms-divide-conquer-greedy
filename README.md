# Java Algorithms — Divide & Conquer, Greedy & Huffman Coding

This project contains Java implementations of fundamental algorithm design techniques developed as part of a Linear Data Structures & Algorithms module.

The focus of the project was to implement classic algorithms entirely from scratch without using built-in sorting or priority queue utilities, demonstrating a strong understanding of recursion, greedy optimisation, and heap-based processing.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Divide & Conquer

* Recursive Fibonacci calculation
* Binary search on sorted arrays
* Tower of Hanoi optimal move generation

### Greedy Algorithms

* Activity selection for maximum non-overlapping tasks
* Minimum coin change using ordered denominations

### Sorting Algorithms

* Merge Sort (recursive divide & merge strategy)
* Quick Sort with in-place partitioning

### Heap & Compression

* Custom heap structure for binary tries
* Huffman coding algorithm for optimal prefix compression
* Encoding and decoding of strings using generated Huffman trees

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Recursive problem solving
* Divide & conquer algorithm design
* Greedy optimisation strategies
* In-place vs auxiliary memory sorting
* Heap data structure implementation
* Prefix trees (binary tries)
* Data compression via Huffman encoding
* Algorithmic time and space efficiency considerations

## Purpose

This project was completed as part of university coursework to demonstrate practical implementation of classical algorithms commonly used in:

* search engines
* data compression systems
* scheduling optimisation
* database indexing
* operating system resource allocation

## Language

Java

## Note

All algorithms were implemented manually for learning purposes rather than relying on Java’s built-in utilities.
